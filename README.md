## ‚ú® Features

- üîÑ Real-time React Query state monitoring
- üé® Beautiful native macOS interface
- üöÄ Automatic connection to Native apps
- üìä Query status visualization
- üîå Socket.IO integration for reliable communication
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Simple setup (temporarily requires manual integration during beta)

## üì¶ Installation

### DevTools Application

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/LovesWorking/rn-better-dev-tools/releases)
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Move the app to your Applications folder
4. Launch the app

### React Native App Integration

See the "Connecting Native Devices" section below for instructions on integrating with your React Native application.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Launch React Native DevTools application
2. Setup your React Native application (see "Connecting Native Devices" below)
3. Start your React Native application(s)
4. DevTools will automatically detect and connect to your running applications

> **Note**: Always launch DevTools before starting your React Native applications to ensure proper connection.

## üì± Connecting Native Devices

**Note**: This is currently in beta testing phase and will be made into a proper package soon.

To connect your React Native app to the DevTools:

1. Copy the `./react-query-external-sync` folder from this repository to your project
2. Install the Socket.IO client in your application:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
   npm install --save-dev socket.io-client

   # Using yarn
   yarn add -D socket.io-client

   # Using pnpm (recommended)
   pnpm add -D socket.io-client
   ```

3. After setting up your React Query context, add the hook:

   ```jsx
   import { useSyncQueriesExternal } from "./path-to-copied-folder/react-query-external-sync";

   useSyncQueriesExternal({
     queryClient,
     socketURL: "http://localhost:42831",
     deviceName: isIOS ? "ios" : "android",
     platform: isIOS ? "ios" : "android",
     deviceId: isIOS ? "ios" : "android",
     extraDeviceInfo: {
       "test-device-info": "test",
     },
     enableLogs: true,
   });
   ```

## üí° Usage Tips

- Keep DevTools running while developing
- Monitor query states in real-time
- View detailed query information
- Track cache updates and invalidations

## üêõ Troubleshooting

Having issues? Check these common solutions:

1. **App Not Connecting**

   - Ensure DevTools is launched before your React Native app
   - Check that your React Native app is running
   - Verify you're on the same network
   - Make sure the `socketURL` is correctly pointing to localhost:42831
   - Verify the Socket.IO client is properly installed in your app
   - Check that the `useSyncQueriesExternal` hook is properly implemented

2. **App Not Starting**

   - Verify you're using the latest version
   - Check system requirements (macOS)
   - Try reinstalling the application

3. **Socket Connection Issues**
   - Make sure no firewall is blocking the connection on port 42831
   - Restart both the DevTools app and your React Native app
   - Check the console logs with `enableLogs: true` for any error messages

For more detailed troubleshooting, see our [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT.md).
